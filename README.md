Hello there! 
You've been invited to participate in an experiment run by Dr. Colress of the Unova region. He has created a specialized simulation for only the strongest of trainers, called the Pokemon Battle Labyrinth! Fight your way through a gauntlet of challenge rooms, manage your resources, and build a team of Pokemon generations 1-8 in this unique, arcade-esque ROM hack.

Main Features:
Most Pokemon, from generation 1-8, are available for capture, including Alolan forms. Pokemon have been rebalanced or changed in some way, through their base stats, abilities, movepools, or typing.
Dizzyegg’s Battle Engine, which comes with the generation 7 battle engine, as well as functional Mega Evolution (Z-moves are not included)!
An optional Nuzlocke mode, completely implemented with Dupes Clause, Species Clause, and Shiny Clause.
An emphasis on challenging gameplay and resource management over story. Expect tricky puzzles, challenging bosses, and great rewards.
Soft level caps intended to emphasize strategy over grinding, as well as a balanced level curve suited to a full party of 6 Pokemon
Shops that service your every need! Buy nearly every item in the game and utilize special services, including Experience training and Move Tutors

QoL Features:
Nature colored stats
Display EV/IV (on the Stats screen, press Start for EVs or Select for IVs)
Bag sorting
BW2 Repel prompts
Reusable TMs
Running indoors
Key items replace HMs, such as the Sledgehammer and the Machete
