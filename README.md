# Introduction

Hello there!
You've been invited to participate in an experiment run by Dr. Colress of the Unova region. He has created a specialized simulation for only the strongest of trainers, called the Pokemon Battle Labyrinth! Fight your way through a gauntlet of challenge rooms, manage your resources, and build a team of Pokemon generations 1-8 in this unique, arcade-esque ROM hack.

This game is a complete deviation from the default 8 Gyms, Elite Four, evil team game progression. Instead, it implements a classic RPG dungeon crawler in Pokémon form. Players must clear different dungeons called “Zones”, and can only access shops/healing spots between Zones. Offering an emphasis on challenging gameplay and resource management over story, Pokemon Battle Labyrinth contains tricky puzzles, difficult bosses, and great rewards.

Completion status: not completed, you can play it up to Zone 25 right now.
